# Science of Science Summer School (S4) Lectures

## Introduction

These are the lecture slides, notebooks, datasets, and exercises for
for the Science of Science Summer School (S4) 2021 (https://s4.scienceofscience.org).

S4 2021 is hosted by the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University and
organized by [Daniel Acuna](https://acuna.io) and [Stephen David](https://hearingbrain.org/people.php).
